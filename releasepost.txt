v2 to fix two typos as well as to test my #link("automation toolkit" "https://github.com/Myaamori/subkt/"). Reproducible repo #link("here" "https://github.com/Myaamori/fragtime") for the curious.
#if($currentTask == "nyaa")You can find the original torrent [here](https://nyaa.si/view/1246433).#end

The latest yuri goodness by the staff that brought you the Kase-san OVA, now with somewhat efforted typesetting and stuff.

Press F for Tear Studio.

Translation, typesetting: Myaamori
Timing: wrd
QC: Lolita
Encoding: KoolKidsK
Special thanks: VardÃ« for doing a nice encode of the TV airing, that ended up going unused because I was too slow at typesetting (sorry).

Only #link("mpv" "https://mpv.io"), and mpv-based players like #link("SMPlayer" "https://www.smplayer.info/"), are supported. Some typesetting may render incorrectly in VSFilter (MPC-HC and the like).
#if($currentTask == "nyaa")
